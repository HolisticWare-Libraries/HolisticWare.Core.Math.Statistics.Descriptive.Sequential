[Skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive or negative, or undefined

[Kurtosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis#Mesokurtic) is a measure of the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable.
