# Xamarin/Microsoft tools in Academia

*   Darko Katovic KIF

In every profession one of the key factors in problem solving is for sure - experience. Pushing the age
limits towards younger kids and students gives them edge because of experience. 
In previous workshops about Xamarin.UITests and Xamarin.Workbooks it was shown how kids in early age can
participate in the work on real-world prjects. It was shown that with Xamarin tools it is possible to start
working even with 10 years old kids and with work on real projects with age of 14. In the early
age it is possible to start with documentation which can be done with Xamarin.Workbooks, while in later 
stags kids or young developers can start working on application testing (either unit testing and/or UI
testng).
This workshop will show some methodic principles how to help academic staff and students to grasp broad
spectrum in the technology and start working on the real (open source) projects. Methodology starts with
business development analysis and research and continues with testing and for those highly motivated ends 
in designing and implementing the libraries.
